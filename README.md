## Strengths of App

This app show cases several react native components and their styling.

## Limitations on App

This app was done rather quickly due to some unforeseen circumstances so there is a lot of improvement that is needed. Some limitations on this app is that it is a very basic app that needs to be broken down and separated in to the correct folders. Currently, the App.js file houses all the logic and information for this app and that should not be the case. Functions, components and screens/views, navigation need to be pulled out of that App.js file. This will make the code easier to read, reuse and understand for others. This app currently doesnt follow encryption and that is a big issue that needs to be fixed especially when storing the api key.Tests need to be made to check that everything works properly.
